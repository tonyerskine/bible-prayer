    <p>
        When I think of all this, I fall to my knees and pray to the You, Father, the Creator of everything
        in heaven and on earth. I pray that from Your glorious, unlimited resources You will empower
        <span class="who object">me</span> with inner strength through Your Spirit. Then Christ will make
        his home in <span class="pronoun possessive">my</span> heart<span class="plural">s</span> as
        <span class="pronoun subject">I</span> trust<span class="singular">s</span> in him.
        <span class="pronoun possessive capitalize">My</span>
        roots will grow down into Your love and keep <span class="pronoun object">me</span> strong. And may
        <span class="who subject">I</span> have the power to understand, as all God’s people should, how
        wide, how long, how high, and how deep Your love is. May <span class="pronoun subject">I</span> experience the love
        of Christ, though it is too great to understand fully. Then <span class="who subject">I</span>
        will be made complete with all the fullness of life and power that comes from You, God.

    <p>
        For this reason I kneel before the You, Father, from whom every family
        in heaven and on the earth is named. I pray that according to the wealth
        of Your glory You may grant <span class="who object">me</span> to be
        strengthened with power through Your Spirit in the inner person, that
        Christ may dwell in <span class="pronoun possessive">my</span> heart<span class="plural">s</span>
        through faith, so that, because <span class="pronoun subject">I</span> have
        been rooted and grounded in love, <span class="who subject">I</span>
        may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and
        length and height and depth, and thus to know the love of Christ that
        surpasses knowledge, so that <span class="who subject">I</span> may be
        filled up to all the fullness of You, God.
